English Language and Culture Goes Together


English is a fantastic language. It is spoken in most parts for the world, even if it sounds very different.
English is more than a language, it is also a culture. They are two sides of the same coin. You should learn both.
Even if you know English this book will teach you many things.
Having lived in London, moving there from Europe, I can tell you that knowing the culture makes you much better at communicating with Londoners.
