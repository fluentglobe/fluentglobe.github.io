	Three things that trip you up when new in Switzerland
</h2>

<p>
We have asked expats in Switzerland about their experiences with moving here in our survey
called "Expat Happiness".
</p>

<p>
Having lived in four cities in four years, we've made our share of mistakes and insights, but it's great
to have feedback from people about the many different
things that can trip you up when you're new.
</p>

<h4> Our finding so far</h4>

<p>75% find that many of the people they meet everyday do not speak a good English, 
making it hard to build a good connection.
</p>

<p>
Most people would like to have Swiss friends and they find it hard to build relationships with them.
</p>

<p>
Most people end up making friends based on the language they speak well. If they do not speak the regional
language they report more problems making friends. 
</p>

<h4>Other things to note</h4>

<p>Most things you might miss can be found in specialist stores(editors note: you may have to look for them)</p>

<p>Apparently there is some impressive road rage going on, and not enough junk food!</p>
