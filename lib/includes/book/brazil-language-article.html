<h1>10 language and culture tips you’ll learn on this book </h1>

<p>•Brazilians don’t speak Spanish. Despite being surrounded by Spanish-speaking countries, Brazilians don’t speak Spanish. It is fairly hard to find a radio station in Brazil where they play Spanish music. Forget about listening to salsa or other Latin rhythms. In Brazil, everyone speaks Portuguese and not many people will be fluent in other languages. </p>

<p>•It’s hard for a Brazilian to understand European Portuguese. Although it is Portuguese, the pronunciation from Portugal can be very different from the one in Brazil. Some words are also different. For example, the word for cup is “chávena” in European Portuguese and “xícara” in Brazil. </p>

<p>•Ordering in a restaurant can be a bit of a challenge in Brazil. You can get the server’s attention by just saying “oi”. </p>

<p>•When ordering a Brazilian style beer (ice cold) you can ask for a “bem gelada” which literally translates as very cold. </p>
<p>•The word for snack bar in Portuguese is “lanchonete”. These are relaxed  places where you can get sandwiches, fruit juices and pastries.</p> 
<p>•The ão sound is very common in Portuguese. It is a very nasal sound, therefore it requires a bit of practice. You’ll hear it in words like “feijão” (beans) and São Paulo. </p>
<p>•The word for party is “balada”. Brazilians never say no to a “balada” and there will be many for the World Cup. </p>
<p>•“Pastel” means cake in Spanish but in Portuguese a “pastel” is a deep-fried pastry filled with many different types of ingredients like cheese, beef or ham. It is one of the most popular snacks in Brazil. </p>
<p>•the word for ATM is "caixa eletrônico”. If you want to withdraw money, you have to look for an ATM that says “saques”. </p>
<p>•In Brazil “Botecos” are very relaxed neighbourhood bars with lively music and atmosphere. They are very different from lounge bars. A “boteco” usually has yellow plastic chairs and tables and people of all ages sit outside chatting while drinking their “cachaça” or beer.   </p>
