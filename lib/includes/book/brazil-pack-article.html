<h1>What to pack for Brazil? </h1>

<p>If you’re heading to Brazil this summer, you may be wondering what items to bring in your suitcase. Some cities are by the beach, while others are inland. Some are also more cosmopolitan than others, therefore it would be good to get a sense of what to pack. Brazilians are very casual when it comes to style. They like their "chinelo no pé” (foot on flip-flop) style. There’s no need to bring expensive belongings like jewellery or designer clothes. It is also better to leave your collar shirt behind as not many people wear them, unless they’re working. </p>

<li>Casual and lightweight clothes like t-shirts and shorts. This is what most Brazilians wear on a daily basis. There’s no need to pack fancy outfits. Ideally, you want to blend in as much as possible to avoid being hassled for money. When I was in Brazil, I had a t-shirt saying “NYC” so people immediately though I was from the USA, even though I look Spanish. Whenever possible, avoid looking like a tourist so you don’t have to pay touristic prices. </li>

<li>A good sunblock. When the sun is out in Brazil, it is very strong. Avoid getting a nasty sunburn. Don’t forget to pack a a sunscreen with a high SPF. Sunblock and other toiletries can be really expensive in Brazil, especially if they are imported ones. </li>
<li>Beach towel. Brazilians don’t really do beach towels. Beach towels are even hard to find in many parts of Brazil. Brazilian women use sarongs or “cangas” which are much lighter than towels while men usually rent beach chairs or they simply stand up, soaking up the sun rays. If you still prefer to lay down and have a snooze on the beach, it is better to bring your own towel. </li>
<li>A raincoat or an umbrella. Despite the high temperatures, torrential rainfall is pretty common and unpredictable. When it rains, it rains hard 24 hours a day, non-stop. So it’s a good idea to pack an umbrella or a raincoat. Remember that the World Cup takes place in winter, so temperatures can drop a lot depending on the region you’ll be staying in. A jacket and some jumpers can also be handy. </li>
<li>An insect repellent. Certain areas of Brazil are a “mosquito paradise”, especially in hot and humid regions. There are way more mosquitoes than people and they usually “attack” at night. </li>
