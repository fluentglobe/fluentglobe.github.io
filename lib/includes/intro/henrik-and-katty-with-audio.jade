    p Hi, I’m are Henrik Vendelbo
    p And, I’m Caterine Apruzzese

    p We moved to Zürich a few years ago from London.
    p Before that We lived in New York.
    p Actually we have moved 4 times in 4 years. It has taught us a lot.

    p Many of our friends have lived in several countries. 
    p
      | So we have been collecting the experiences 
      | and piecing together The Stress-Free First Year formula.

    p 
      | For the past 3 years I’ve been writing language books and I believe the best way to learn a language is by living it and getting to experience the culture.<br> 
      | Learning the local language is of course part of the formula, but we have a different approach focused on getting to socialise and network quickly.

    p 
      | We are making a complimentary presentation for a Stress-Free First Year in your City, so you can enjoy life there. <br>
      | If you live in Switzerland you can get it free of charge right away, otherwise you will have to wait a bit for us to finish it for your city.

    p This presentation is for Expats that have just moved to a new city and want to get the most out of the place and the people
    p If you are just visiting for a holiday or a business trip, this isn't for you

    p As expats we would like to share our experience with others in the same situation

    p So if this is you, just fill in the form, and we will get you started A.S.A.P.
