<h2>How would your life be if you understood Swiss-German?</h2>

<p>I don't know about you but I feel like a complete idiot when mingling with a group of friends and acquaintances talking Swiss-German and only understanding 2 out of every 10 words.</p>
<p>I'm in their contry and the language shouldn't be all that hard to learn with it's simplified grammar and wide range of acceptable pronunciations.</p>

<p>So we want to be able to <b>understand regular conversations</b> and give simple answers and comments in Swiss German. It really shouldn't be that hard.
After all <b>most people</b> that have lived here 5+ years understand most conversations even if they don't speak fluently.</p>
