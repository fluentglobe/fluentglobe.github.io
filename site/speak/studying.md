Studying
========

We try to teach everything in the language so you can focus. 
This is why our lessons are not in your own language.
Before the lesson starts have a look at the comments(on the cover) for you in your own language, and then it is time to start.


### Reviewing

Before reviewing a section write down the words you remember from the section on a blank piece of paper.
When you review take extra time with the trouble words, and if you still don't know the meaning look it up in a dictionary. <link>
Pay special attention to words that you didn't remember before you began.

You can also use the Voice Memo app  to record your pronunciation to check how you sound.


### With Our Speaking Books

Now it is time to learn the words.
If you get stuck look at the picture to give you a clue. 
If you see a thumb in the corner it is a reminder that you can tap on the pictures to hear the phrase. 
When you see a head tap it to get more information and tips. 
Be careful to leave these for later if you can, so you can focus on English.
When you listen to a phrase, speak it out loud. 
In fact speak as much as you can. 
If you think of a word say it again.
Go through the words and meanings several times before the next page.

“If you have trouble with a word mark it for later. Try to guess based on the surroundings and leave it at that.
Whenever you have done 3 pages, go back and run through the previous two.
When you have done 10 pages, go back and run through the previous 9.
Before going to bed, go through the pages you have studied on the day.
In the morning try to write down the words that you remember on a blank piece of paper.Don't worry about spelling, it is remembering that matters.
Doing this will help you remember the words, which is after all the whole point.
This is made as an iBook Textbook. Read more about using it.
