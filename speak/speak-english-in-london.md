“English is a fantastic language. It is spoken in most parts for the world, even if it sounds very different.
English is more than a language, it is also a culture. They are two sides of the same coin. You should learn both.

Even if you know English this book will teach you many things.
Having lived in London, moving there from Europe, I can tell you that knowing the culture makes you much better at communicating with Londoners.

Peculiar things you will learn,

* How do Brits greet each other?​
*  Being on time
* ​ Queuing​  

Like me you probably learned foreign languages in School. That can still be a great way to learn and most people still do. However sitting in a classroom isn’t really the ideal language learning environment.

Languages should be learned through immersion. You want to surround yourself with the topic. 
If you really want to learn you want learning any time anywhere.
The iPad is the perfect tool for learning.


The third thing you want to do is focus. If you try to learn everything it will take years to become good enough. If you focus you can become good much faster.

Focus on practical spoken language first. Learn to understand and speak the real english. 
Learn to do it without thinking hard.


## Learn with a spoken book

Our spoken book contains thousands of spoken phrases. 
You listen to them to become familiar to the sounds making up the English language.

Most pictures have sounds. So, just like the picture here, you can just tap it to hear the phrase

This way you learn a useful sentence, and know how it should sound.



    Many people go to language school to have classmates. 
    Follow Fluent Globe on Linked In or Google+ and join 
    other people thatstudy like you.

So you have decided to learn English. Now you have to decide when and how often.

With Fluent Globe we help you keep the regular schedule, and keep the progress.
We also give you a bunch of great videos to study with.

## How can I read the book?

Our book is made to be read on a touch table. Actually this isn't a text book, but rather a spoken book. Most e-books are a simple affair of pure text. Most tablets only really support text books.

For now we are only able to offer the book on the iPad. When other
tablets become capable we will look at supporting them.



“Your First Lesson (Greetings)
We try to teach everything in English so you can focus. Before the lesson starts there are a couple of comments for you in your own language, and then it is time to start.
Now it is time to learn the words.
If you get stuck look at the picture to give you a clue. 
If you see a thumb in the corner it is a reminder that you can tap on the pictures to hear the phrase. 
When you see a head tap it to get more information and tips. Be careful to leave these for later if you can, so you can focus on English.
When you listen to a phrase, speak it out loud. In fact speak as much as you can. If you think of a word say it again.
Go through the words and meanings several times before the next page. If you have trouble with a word mark it for later. Try to guess based on the surroundings and leave it at that.
Whenever you have done 3 pages, go back and run through the previous two.
When you have done 10 pages, go back and run through the[…]”



“Immersion

Like me you probably learned foreign languages in School. That can still be a great way to learn and most people still do. However sitting in a classroom isn’t really the ideal language learning environment.
Languages should be learned through immersion. You want to surround yourself with the topic.
One great way is to label things in your house as you learn the new words. 
When you learn the word “wake up”. Write it on a Post-It or sticker and put that on your alarm clock. Every time you use it say the word aloud. Practical Spoken Language
When you travel understanding what people say is the most important thing. It can be very difficult as there are many accents and ways to say something.
You should listen to many real conversations and try to repeat them yourself to get the feel. You can also try to exaggerate the pronunciation.
Reading and writing that is best learned when you feel comfortable speaking. After listening, learning to pronounce the words is the next thing to learn.
We focus on practical language rather than the formal kind. It is what you will hear every day when you travel, so[…]”
