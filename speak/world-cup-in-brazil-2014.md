English is a fantastic language. It is spoken in most parts for the world, even if it sounds very different.

English is more than a language, it is also a culture. They are two sides of the same coin. You should learn both.

Even if you know English this book will teach you many things.
Having lived in London, moving there from Europe, I can tell you that knowing the culture makes you much better at communicating with Londoners.

<blockquote>Londoners have unique everyday words</blockquote>

Peculiar things you will learn,

* How do Brits greet each other?​
*  Being on time
* ​ Queuing​  

Like me you probably learned foreign languages in School. That can still be a great way to learn and most people still do. However sitting in a classroom isn’t really the ideal language learning environment.

Languages should be learned through immersion. You want to surround yourself with the topic. 
If you really want to learn you want learning any time anywhere.
The iPad is the perfect tool for learning.


The third thing you want to do is focus. If you try to learn everything it will take years to become good enough. If you focus you can become good much faster.

Focus on practical spoken language first. Learn to understand and speak the real english. 
Learn to do it without thinking hard.

## Learn with a spoken book

Our spoken book contains thousands of spoken phrases. 
You listen to them to become familiar to the sounds making up the English language.
